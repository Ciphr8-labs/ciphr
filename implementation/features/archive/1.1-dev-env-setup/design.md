## Architecture and Design Patterns

### Overall Architecture

The development environment follows a **Layered Architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Infrastructure Layer:** Devbox, CI/CD, external tools
2. **Configuration Layer:** Feature flags, environment setup, tool configuration  
3. **Development Tools Layer:** Testing, linting, documentation generation
4. **Application Interface Layer:** CLI commands, justfile tasks, developer workflows

### Design Patterns

#### Configuration Pattern
- **Use Case:** Centralized configuration management across all development tools
- **Implementation:** Builder pattern for configuration construction with validation
- **Benefits:** Type-safe configuration, environment-specific overrides, validation at startup

```rust
pub struct ConfigBuilder {
    environment: Option<Environment>,
    log_level: Option<LogLevel>,
    feature_flags: HashMap<String, bool>,
}

impl ConfigBuilder {
    pub fn build(self) -> Result<Config, ConfigError> {
        // Validation and construction logic
    }
}
```

#### Feature Flag Pattern  
- **Use Case:** Safe rollout of experimental features and A/B testing capabilities
- **Implementation:** Strategy pattern with pluggable evaluation engines
- **Benefits:** Risk mitigation, gradual rollout, easy rollback of problematic features

```rust
pub trait FeatureFlagEvaluator {
    fn is_enabled(&self, flag_name: &str, context: &EvaluationContext) -> bool;
}

pub struct PercentageRolloutEvaluator {
    // Implementation for percentage-based rollouts
}
```

#### Observer Pattern for Build Events
- **Use Case:** Coordinating build pipeline steps and notifications
- **Implementation:** Event-driven architecture with typed events and handlers
- **Benefits:** Loose coupling, extensible pipeline, audit trail of build events

```rust
pub trait BuildEventHandler {
    fn handle(&self, event: &BuildEvent) -> Result<(), BuildError>;
}

pub enum BuildEvent {
    TestSuiteStarted { suite_name: String },
    TestCompleted { test_name: String, result: TestResult },
    ArtifactGenerated { artifact: BuildArtifact },
}
```

#### Command Pattern for Development Tasks
- **Use Case:** Encapsulating development tasks (test, build, lint) as executable commands
- **Implementation:** Command pattern with undo/redo capabilities for reversible operations
- **Benefits:** Consistent interface, composable workflows, error handling standardization
