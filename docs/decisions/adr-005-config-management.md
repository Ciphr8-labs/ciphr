# ADR-005: Git-Based Configuration Management with TOML Format
**Date**: 2025-06-19  
**Status**: accepted

#### Context
Configuration management must support environment-specific overrides, be human-readable for community contributions, provide type safety, and integrate with version control workflows. The solution affects developer productivity and error rates.

#### Decision
Use TOML files for configuration with Git-based storage, providing human-readable configuration with schema validation and environment-specific overlay capabilities.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Human-readable format accessible to all contributors
- Excellent Rust ecosystem support with serde
- Version control integration for configuration change tracking
- Type-safe parsing with compile-time validation
- Comments and documentation support within configuration files

**Negative**:
- File-based configuration requires file system access
- No built-in encryption for sensitive configuration values
- Manual configuration synchronization across environments
- Potential merge conflicts in collaborative development
