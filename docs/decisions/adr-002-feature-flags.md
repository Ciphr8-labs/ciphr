# ADR-002: Implement Feature Flag System from Project Start
**Date**: 2025-06-19  
**Status**: accepted

#### Context
The project will evolve from CLI tool to comprehensive accounting platform with experimental features, community contributions, and paid features. Traditional branching strategies become complex with multiple feature development streams. Risk mitigation for new features is essential in financial software.

#### Decision
Implement a comprehensive feature flag system from the beginning of the project, allowing runtime feature toggling, gradual rollouts, and safe experimentation.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Safe deployment of experimental features
- Gradual rollout capabilities reducing risk
- A/B testing capabilities for feature validation
- Easy rollback without code deployment
- Community testing of beta features

**Negative**:
- Additional complexity in codebase with conditional logic
- Technical debt from old feature flags requiring cleanup
- Potential performance overhead from flag evaluation
- Configuration management complexity
