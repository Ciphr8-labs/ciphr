# ADR-003: Use Rust with Structured Logging for Development Infrastructure
**Date**: 2025-06-19  
**Status**: accepted

#### Context
Development infrastructure requires high reliability, performance, and maintainability. The choice affects debugging capabilities, error tracking, and operational monitoring. The solution must scale from single developer to community project with multiple contributors.

#### Decision
Use Rust as the primary language with tracing-based structured logging throughout the development infrastructure and eventual application codebase.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Memory safety eliminates classes of bugs common in infrastructure code
- Excellent performance for command-line tools and build processes
- Strong type system catches configuration and integration errors at compile time
- Structured logging provides excellent debugging and monitoring capabilities
- Growing ecosystem with excellent tooling

**Negative**:
- Longer compilation times compared to interpreted languages
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with Rust
- Smaller talent pool compared to mainstream languages
- Some dependencies may be less mature than in older ecosystems
