## How Can I Contribute?

You can contribute in many ways, from reporting bugs and suggesting features to writing documentation and submitting code.

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with the `enhancement` label.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.

### Pull Requests

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.

- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!
